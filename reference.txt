<p>Jobs fill your pocket; adventure fill your soul. Have you had an adventure that touches your heart so deeply every time you think about it? I really hope you do because every time you remember is filling your soul on a way that can change a bad day. This topic is really one of my favorite ones because of the truth is behind it</p>

            <p>Was this world just created to just be born, go to college, retire and die? Excuse me, but I think not so. <strong>There has to be more to human experience</strong>. A significant fraction of the world's population hate what they do for a living or how they go about their living -- and guess what? They don't tell you!</p>
